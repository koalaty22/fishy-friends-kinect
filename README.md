# fishy-friends-kinect
These projects were developed for a University project (DXH602 - Embodied Interactions)
This Hi-Fi prototype is a proof of concept.
The Kinect version of the code requies a Kinect vr1, Processing vr 3.5.3 and SimpleOpenNI to use.
THe normal version called fish_prototype_complete only needs Processing (any version is fine).

Here are some very early iterations of the code done by another group member.
These early iterations where a good launchpad into developing the future prototype
